```
database migration tool like Alembic, Flyway, or Liquibase.

So, to summarize:

Database Migration Tools: Apply structural changes to the database itself.
Git Version Control: Tracks changes to the codebase, including database schema and migration scripts, but does not apply these changes to the database.

✅ You should not use client and server term for backend and frontend      




Web browser /client  incontext with react or frontent applicagion

Web browser asks html js and css amd rended with react logic in user browser itself

But in next.js rendered file is sent to user browser. Future rendering happens of browser or client 

Most of times static files are rendered using ssr but we can also render dynamic content by asking backend since backend is inside next so it takes less time t o roundtrip or communciate 

Ususally servers(like ec2where frontend is hosted) are more powerful than browsser/client so rendering take less time on server/frontend.


React iz client with express

Exlress is client with mongodb


❤️Monorepo backend & frontend code in 1 repo to maintain consistent coding paradigm. eg : react & express in same repo like in my ecommerce app

Next is not monorepo but with using it has both frontend and backend in same app.

Forward proxy is like vpn where different people request to same vpn and that vpn request to 1 server
Load balancing is a very important functionality of Reverse proxy 
NGINX provides load balancing 
In spring boot Reverse proxy is done using Apache Tomcat (Apache is common reverse proxy, but tomcat is specially designed for java)
