âœ… Web browser /client  incontext with react or frontent applicagion

Web browser asks html js and css amd rended with react logic in user browser itself

But in next.js rendered file is sent to user browser

Most of times static files are rendered using ssr but we can also render dynamic content by asking backend server express since express is inside next so it takes less time to communciate 

React iz client with express

Exlress is client with mongodb


Forward proxy is like vpn where different people request to same vpn and that vpn request to 1 server
Load balancing is a very important functionality of Reverse proxy 
NGINX provides load balancing 
In spring boot Reverse proxy is done using Apache Tomcat (Apache is common reverse proxy, but tomcat is specially designed for java)
